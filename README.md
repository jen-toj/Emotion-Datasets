# Emotions-Datasets
This repository contains a database consisting of different images/videos collected from undergrad students of the University of Monterrey experiencing different emotions due to audiovisual stimuli with previous experimentation endorsed to provoke said emotions. Our end goal was to perform a facial analysis and, through a neural network architecture; to be able to classify the type of emotion present in the user as a reaction to the stimulus in question.

## Background
This Dataset was used for the thesis project called *"Emotions recognition through facial analysis"* to obtain the mechatronics engineering bachelor's degree at Universidad de Monterrey. Our motivation was to 
find a way to mitigate the security problems reported by users, mostly female passengers, of private transportation platforms (e.g. Uber, Didi, Cabify, etc.) Our proposal was to develop a computer vision application with a camera installed in the vehicle cabin capable of detecting specific emotions from the passenger to predict risky situations while using this services. 
We used neural networks and to train our algorithm we obtained our own dataset by multiple researches on how to generate emotions ethically.

## Methodology 
The experimental tests were carried out in a designated room within the facilities of the Universidad de Monterrey, the participants were members of the university and decided to take part in the research voluntarily after having read and signed the informed consent form. The population studied will consist of men and women of adulthood with Spanish as their native language, 60 men and 60 women between 18 and 23 years old. 
The volunteers were received in the room and the informed consent form was read, all doubts that may arised from the volunteer regarding the protocol were answered and the signature of the document was collected. 
We explained to the participant that we will be recording while different movie scenes are projected on a laptop, and at the same time they are wearing a pulse oximeter. We told them that the aim of the study is to gain more knowledge about emotions so the experiment required to present movie clips that potentially elicit a wide range of emotions. In addition, we asked the volunteers to keep their hands on the desk as much as possible and face the clips.
The volunteers are informed that they can end their participation at any time and that their responses are anonymous. This was the general procedure to collect the database:
1. The volunteer must sit in a chair in front of a table, the same position in which they will remain for approximately 15 minutes, and the pulse oximeter will be placed on the tip of the index finger.
2. The participant will perform the designated test to transmit **anger** 
  - Visual stimulus: 
     - Excerpt from the film “American History X” (A neo-Nazi kills a man by crushing his head) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0vHfAh9Nfk
3. It takes 2 minutes for the participant to complete a distraction task: it will consist of 30 seconds in which they will be asked to identify geometric figures with some particular characteristic to capture attention.
4. The participant will carry out the test designed to transmit **happiness**
- Visual Stimulus: 
   - Film fragment "When Harry Met Sally" (Sally simulates an orgasm in a cafeteria) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeYdQdzlb4
5. It takes 2 minutes for you to complete a distraction task.
6. The participant will see the scene designated to transmit **fear**
- Viual Stimulus
   - Segment of the movie "The Blair Witch Project" (Final scene in which the protagonists apparently die) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOB7Hl4YHt8
7. It takes 2 minutes for the participant to complete a distraction task.
8. This last clip is intended to facilitate the emotional recovery process, particularly after exposure to negative stimuli.
- Audiovisual stimulus
   - Excerpt from the song “Dancing Queen” by ABBA
9. To end the experiment, the pulse oximeter is removed from the participant and they are thanked for their participation.
  The participant is asked to fill out the post-test form: It is pointed out that they must answer this by reporting what they personally felt while viewing the scene and not what they thought people should feel with that scene.
