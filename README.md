# Emotions-Datasets
This repository contains a database consisting of different images/videos collected from undergrad students of the University of Monterrey experiencing different emotions due to audiovisual stimuli with previous experimentation endorsed to provoke said emotions. Our end goal was to perform a facial analysis and, through a neural network architecture; to be able to classify the type of emotion present in the user as a reaction to the stimulus in question.

## Background
This Dataset was used for the thesis project called *"Emotions recognition through facial analysis"* to obtain the mechatronics engineering bachelor's degree at Universidad de Monterrey. Our motivation was to 
find a way to mitigate the security problems reported by users, mostly female passengers, of private transportation platforms (e.g. Uber, Didi, Cabify, etc.) Our proposal was to develop a computer vision application with a camera installed in the vehicle cabin capable of detecting specific emotions from the passenger to predict risky situations while using this services. 
We used neural networks and to train our algorithm we obtained our own dataset by multiple researches on how to generate emotions ethically.

## Methodology 
The experimental tests were carried out in a designated room within the facilities of the Universidad de Monterrey, the test subjects are members of the university community and decided to take part in the research protocol voluntarily after having read and signed the informed consent form. The population studied will consist of men and women of adulthood with Spanish as their native language, 60 men and 60 women between 18 and 23 years old.
